[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sasa1977/elixir-in-action.svg?branch=2nd-edition)](https://travis-ci.org/sasa1977/elixir-in-action)

This branch contains accompanying code for [Elixir in Action, Second Edition](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action-second-edition). To compile and run the code, you'll need Elixir 1.6 and Erlang 20.x. A `git` client should also be installed and available somewhere in the execution path.

The code for the first edition can be found [here](https://github.com/sasa1977/elixir-in-action/tree/edition-1). Later updates made to the first edition code can be found [here](https://github.com/sasa1977/elixir-in-action/tree/post-release-updates).
